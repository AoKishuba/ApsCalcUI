ApsCalc: a calculator for optimizing shells for the Advanced Projectile System in From the Depths. Written by Ao Kishuba.
Special thanks to HerpeDerpeDerp and MrNukealizer, without whom this project would not have been possible.

TEST PARAMETERS
Barrel Count: number of barrels. APS cannons can have anywhere from 1-6 barrels. Additional barrels help cooling, but impose an accuracy penalty and limit max gauge.
n.b. I have never seen any measurable increase in performance from using multiple barrels, even for smaller/beltfed loaders, and the gauge restrictions put a hard cap
on performance for larger or chemical shells.

Minimum Gauge: smallest gauge to be tested, in mm. Must be greater than 18 mm.
Maximum Gauge: largest gauge to be tested, in mm. Must be greater than or equal than Minimum Gauge and less than or equal to 500 mm (or the max allowed by the
barrel count, whichever is less).

Head Indices: modules to be put at the front of the shells to be tested. The frontmost module on a shell is weighted in certain calculations, and can have a large
effect on shell performance. Some heads, like the Disruptor Conduit, add functionality. Any module other than the dedicated base modules can be put at the front of a
shell, although the dedicated "Head" modules offer the best performance for any shell type.

Base Module: module to be put at the back of the projectile (the part of the shell which hits the target - excludes gunpowder and railgun casings). The base modules
add functionality or modify performance, and in general it is recommended to use some kind of a base. Base Bleeder is a good default choice.

Fixed Modules: modules to be included with every shell. Primarily meant for fuzes. If testing for pendepth (APHE, APF, &c), adding a single fixed chem warhead will 
save a small amount of time, since at least one will be needed.

Variable Module Indices: the optimizer will test every possible combination of variable modules. Examples would be Solid Body and Sabot Body for kinetic shells, or 
Solid Body and Chem Body for pendepth.

Max Gunpowder Casings: maximum allowed number of GP casings. Note that GP casing length is adjustable up to two decimal places, although a decimal casing counts as
a complete module for module count limit purposes.
Bore Evacuator: whether a bore evacuator will be used. A bore evacuator is an APS component which forms part of the barrel and increases the efficiency of coolers.

Max Railgun Casings: maximum allowed number of RG casings. RG casings increase the max rail draw of the shell, but are not part of the projectile, and so do not
reduce the shell velocity for a given amount of charge. This means a shell with RG casings can be "supercharged" to go faster than it would under its own max draw.

Max Rail Draw: maximum allowed rail draw. Note that each shell has its own max rail draw, determined by the size of the shell (gauge and number of non-GP components), 
and the optimizer will use that limit or this one, whichever is lower for a particular shell.

Max Shell Length: maximum length of the shell. Must be greater than the smallest possible shell - ie, one with the minimum gauge, made up only of fixed modules. This
value is shown in the console as part of the prompt.

Minimum Velocity: minimum shell velocity. Note that a high minimum velocity may be impossible to meet within the casing and rail draw restrictions.
Minimum Effective Range: effective range is the distance a shell will travel in its "lifetime", after which it will become useless. Particularly small shells may have 
an effective range of less than 1 km, and may not be suitable for use on certain craft.

Damage Type: damage type to optimize.
  0. Kinetic. Prompts entry of target AC value/s. Note that more than one AC value can be entered; each will be run as a separate test
  1. Chemical. Results are displayed in generic "Chem damage" units. All chemical warheads have identical scaling, so one can take the optimal EMP shell and swap in 
  HE warheads to get the optimal HE shell
  2. Pendepth. Prompts entry of target armor configuration. Measures chemical damage, but only shells capable of penetrating the given armor scheme will be counted.
  3. Shield Disruptor. Automatically replaces user-given Head List with the Disruptor Conduit Head, which is required for shield disruption. Measures chemical damage 
  and shield reduction percentage (displayed in the printout as a decimal, where 1 = 100% shield strength reduction)

Test Type: whether to optimize for DPS per Volume or DPS per Cost. "Volume" and "Cost" are both marginal - they include the volume (or cost) only of components which
scale linearly with number of inputs. That is to say, components like the APS firing piece, barrels, gauge increases, ejectors, &c, are not counted, because their 
proprotion of the cost depends on the size of the gun. The components which are counted are the loader, input, recoil absorbers, coolers, and rail chargers. Beltfed
loaders assume a fixed configuration of 1 clip and 2 inputs per loader.

Labels: whether to include labels on each line of the printout. Labels make reading much quicker, but get in the way of copying the results to a spreadsheet. If the 
user enters 'n', the optimizer will print the row headers once, then print the resulting shells below.

Write to File: whether to write the results to a text file or to the console. Depending on the OS, the console may be inconvenient to use, or may have a character 
limit; also, printing to a file allows the user to start another batch of tests while preserving the current results. If the user enters 'f', the optimizer will 
output the results of each test to a separate file. The files will be located in the folder with the ApsCalc executable in it; the console will display the complete
path for each file as it is created.
